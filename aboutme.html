<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Full-Stack Developer & AI Enthusiast
    Building AI-driven applications and consumer-ready platforms at the intersection of design, engineering, and impact
    </h2>
<h3>I'm an incoming sophomore at Georgia State University and a passionate full-stack developer building AI-driven applications and consumer-ready platforms. With over 10 hackathons, Machine Learning and Deep Learning pipeline, an iOS app internship experience, certification and programs with industry specialists and universities like Stanford and MIT, I thrive at the intersection of design, engineering, and impact.

    ðŸŽ¯ Most notably, I led MetabolX at HackPrincetonâ€”applying metabolite data and ML/DL on 20K+ biomedical samples (97.2% accuracy), deploying it on Flask with GPT explanations, Docker scalability, and security-out-of-the-box. The project taught me discipline in execution, bridging technical and biological domains, and practical impact from data-driven insights.
    
    On GitHub (kbhatnagar1506.github.io), I showcase endâ€‘toâ€‘end work: from preprocessing and model training pipelines to REST APIs and clientâ€‘side dashboards. My tech stack runs Python/TensorFlow â†’ Flask backend â†’ React UI, and I'm also fluent in Swift, JavaScript/TypeScript, and AWS.
    
    My goal: â€” to break into big tech via powerhouse FAANG-level internships by Summer 2027. I'm currently accelerating my DSA + ML + DL + NLP + AWS skills, sharpening full-stack delivery, and building a standout catalog of production-grade ML apps.
    
    Incoming Sophomore at GSU
